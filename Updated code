Handle Step Function Failure | Create and update resources on dev env

As a system or developer,
I want to handle Step Function failures effectively,
so that failed transfer events are captured, and notified.

Acceptance Criteria (AC)
	1. Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Creation
		A DLQ is created and attached as a target to the DataTransfer EventBridge.
		Failed transfer events are captured and sent to the DLQ.

	2. Notification SQS Creation & Integration
		A Notification SQS queue is created.
		The Notification SQS queue is configured as an output for the DataTransfer SFNTrigger Lambda.
 
	3. Create DLQ to attach to Notification SQS
	
	4. Error Notifier Lambda Integration
		The Notification SQS queue is set as a trigger for the Error Notifier Lambda.
		Error Notifier Lambda processes messages from Notification SQS.

	5. Error Notifier Lambda Modification
		Error Notifier Lambda is modified to handle and parse messages as per the required format.
		The lambda sends notifications upon failure events.
 
	6. Test Case Updates
		Unit and integration test cases are updated to cover the new functionality.
 
	7. Tests ensure messages flow correctly from EventBridge to DLQ, and Notification SQS, and finally to the Error Notifier Lambda.


Handle Step Function Failure | Terraform Template Creation

As a Developer,
I want to create Terraform templates for failure handling,
so that AWS infrastructure for DLQ, Notification SQS, and Lambda integration is provisioned automatically.

Acceptance Criteria (AC)
	1. Terraform Template Creation
		A Terraform template is created to provision the DLQ, Notification SQS, and necessary Lambda integrations.

	2. DLQ Configuration in Terraform
		Terraform defines a DLQ and attaches it to DataTransfer EventBridge.

	3. Notification SQS Configuration in Terraform
		Terraform provisions the Notification SQS queue and configures it as an output to the DataTransfer Manifest Lambda.
 
	4. Error Notifier Lambda Setup in Terraform
		Terraform adds the Notification SQS as a trigger for the Error Notifier Lambda.
 
	5. Terraform Deployment Validation

	6. Terraform template are tested for successful deployment.
		Deployed resources match the required infrastructure setup.


I want US component-wise like 
we are creating DLQ on aws console also we are creating a template for that so it should be one use story like wise for sqs ane other.
please update it
