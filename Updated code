Subject: Request for Laptop Replacement

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to bring to your attention some challenges I am facing with my current laptop, which are significantly impacting my productivity.

My project involves CPU-intensive tasks that require ample storage and memory, which my current laptop, with the following specifications, is unable to handle efficiently:
	•	Processor: Intel Core i5
	•	RAM: 8GB
	•	SSD: 512GB
	•	Operating System: Dual boot (Windows and Ubuntu) as per project requirements

Due to these limitations, I am encountering the following issues:
	1.	System Crashes During High Computational Tasks: The laptop frequently crashes while running CPU-intensive processes, making it difficult to accomplish my work effectively.
	2.	Storage and Memory Constraints: The existing hardware configuration is insufficient for the project’s demands, leading to slowdowns and inefficiencies.
	3.	Keyboard Malfunctions: When the system crashes, the keyboard sometimes stops working, and I have to restart the laptop to resolve the issue.
	4.	Camera Malfunction: The built-in camera has accumulated dust and no longer functions properly, which is problematic during virtual meetings.
	5.	Zscaler Issues: After the laptop enters sleep mode, Zscaler often fails to reconnect upon login. Restarting Zscaler or the system takes about 5 minutes, causing unnecessary delays.
	6.	Other Small Issues: There are additional minor problems that collectively hinder my workflow.

Given these challenges, I kindly request a replacement laptop with the following minimum specifications to meet the demands of my project:
	•	Processor: Intel Core i7
	•	RAM: 16GB
	•	SSD: More than 512GB
	•	Operating System: Dual boot (Windows and Ubuntu)

A system with these specifications would enable me to work efficiently without interruptions and improve overall productivity.

Please let me know if further details are required or if there is a specific process I need to follow for this request. I appreciate your understanding and support in this matter.

Best regards,
Chetan
