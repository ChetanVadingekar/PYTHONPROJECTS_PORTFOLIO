Database filtering for invalid data.  
    Sota-san image is it should not crash the Statistics page and Home page. 
    Without modifying the upload tool, as in one of the region upload tool was not utilized. 
    Is the data to be remove from bucket as well ?  
    Should the data to be removed from database also? 
    How to handle existing invalid data? 
    Is the invalid data been removed from all the three data sources (DDB tables, Opensearch Indices & S3 buckets)? 
    Is there any date range information recorded, where invalid data is entered? 
    Does Sota-san needs any frontend interface to analyze the invalid data entered in the system?
