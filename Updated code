Subject: Request for Laptop Replacement Due to Performance and Hardware Issues

Description:
I am requesting a replacement for my current laptop due to several issues impacting my productivity:
	1.	Frequent crashes during high computational tasks, which are essential for my project.
	2.	Insufficient specifications (Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for CPU-intensive tasks and dual-boot requirements (Windows and Ubuntu).
	3.	Hardware problems such as a malfunctioning camera and keyboard issues after system crashes, requiring frequent restarts.
	4.	Zscaler connectivity issues after sleep mode, causing delays.

These limitations hinder my ability to complete tasks efficiently. Kindly provide a replacement laptop with higher specifications to resolve these issues.

Let me know if this works for you!
