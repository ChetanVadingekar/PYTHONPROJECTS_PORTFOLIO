I want to store the query executed by the end user and the respective response against the query along with user information in DDB Table.

query: I want to see Snow data

response:

{
  "data": [
    {
      "display_id": "ec1db8d2-8355-4301-b955-bd076b984aad"
    },
    {
      "display_id": "431f82a0-4065-44db-b8a5-2ed4e9f67f3f"
    }
  ],
  "status": 200,
  "total": 2
}

So I want to design the DynamoDb schema.

Few things we need to consider user might execute same query after some time,
so need to distingush the uniqueness in the table design.
