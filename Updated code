Refactor fetch-filter-attributes-v2 API to add Authorization.
Current route:
/fetch-filter-attributes-v2
Refactoring to routes:
/api/v1/driveSessions/filters
/api/v1/eventSessions/filters
/api/v1/driveSessions/status/filters

This is the highlevel user story points give me the AC, DOD and DOR for frontend and backend.


Here’s a detailed breakdown of the Acceptance Criteria (AC), Definition of Done (DoD), and Definition of Ready (DoR) for the frontend and backend tasks related to the refactor:

Frontend

Acceptance Criteria (AC)
	1.	The application must consume the new API routes:
	•	/api/v1/driveSessions/filters
	•	/api/v1/eventSessions/filters
	•	/api/v1/driveSessions/status/filters
	2.	Update API calls to include proper authorization tokens in the headers.
	3.	Ensure the UI displays filter attributes correctly for both drive sessions and event sessions.
	4.	Provide meaningful error messages for authorization failures or API errors (e.g., 401, 403, 500).
	5.	Retain the same user experience and design with no regressions.

Definition of Done (DoD)
	1.	Code is implemented, committed, and pushed to the repository.
	2.	The updated API routes are fully integrated into the frontend.
	3.	Frontend unit and integration tests are written, executed, and pass successfully.
	4.	Manual testing confirms proper handling of both authorized and unauthorized scenarios.
	5.	Documentation is updated (if necessary) for API usage and authentication handling in the frontend.

Definition of Ready (DoR)
	1.	Clear requirements for the new API endpoints are shared and understood.
	2.	Mock data or a working backend is available for development and testing.
	3.	Authorization method (e.g., Bearer tokens) and error scenarios are documented.
	4.	UI/UX acceptance criteria and dependencies are agreed upon with the team.

Backend

Acceptance Criteria (AC)
	1.	The existing /fetch-filter-attributes-v2 route must be deprecated.
	2.	New routes /api/v1/driveSessions/filters, /api/v1/eventSessions/filters, and /api/v1/driveSessions/status/filters are implemented.
	3.	Implement role-based authorization logic to ensure only authorized users can access the API.
	4.	Ensure proper response codes for both successful and failed authorization.
	5.	Backward compatibility is maintained until the frontend is fully integrated.
	6.	API endpoints must adhere to RESTful standards.

Definition of Done (DoD)
	1.	Code for new routes is implemented and pushed to the repository.
	2.	Authorization middleware is implemented and tested for all new routes.
	3.	Unit and integration tests are written and executed, covering successful cases, unauthorized access, and error scenarios.
	4.	API documentation is updated to include the new routes, parameters, and authorization details.
	5.	Postman collection or other API testing scripts are updated for the new routes.

Definition of Ready (DoR)
	1.	Approval of the new route structure from stakeholders or the API design team.
	2.	Authorization requirements (roles, tokens, etc.) are clearly defined and shared.
	3.	Test cases for unit and integration testing are agreed upon.
	4.	Clear deprecation plan for the old endpoint /fetch-filter-attributes-v2.

These criteria ensure smooth development and transition for both the backend and frontend refactor tasks. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
