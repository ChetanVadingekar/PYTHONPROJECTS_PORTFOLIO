Subject: Response to Review Comments

Dear [Manager’s Name],

Thank you for your feedback and for acknowledging my technical skills in AWS and Python, as well as my ability to deliver tasks on time.

Regarding your observations:
	1.	Office Attendance: I understand the HR mandate and will ensure compliance by attending the office as required.
	2.	Scrum and JIRA Process: I would like to share that I am already following the Scrum process and JIRA guidelines. However, I will ensure that all stories and story points are consistently added during sprint planning to maintain transparency and improve planning accuracy.

I appreciate your guidance and will continue to strive for improvement. Please let me know if there’s anything else I can address.

Best regards,
Chetan
