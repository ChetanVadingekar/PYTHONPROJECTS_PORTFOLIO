Hereâ€™s how you can structure the JIRA ticket with Acceptance Criteria (AC), Definition of Ready (DoR), and Definition of Done (DoD) for the bug:

Acceptance Criteria (AC):

	1.	The get-project-details API should handle incorrect or malformed data in the drive session table without crashing.
	2.	The API should return a meaningful error response with appropriate status codes (e.g., 400 or 422 for client-side errors, 500 with an explanatory message for server-side issues).
	3.	Logs should clearly indicate the cause of the issue for debugging purposes.
	4.	The fix should not affect the existing functionality of the API.
	5.	Proper unit and integration tests should be in place to ensure the bug is resolved.

Definition of Ready (DoR):

	1.	The bug has been acknowledged and prioritized in the sprint backlog.
	2.	All necessary details about the incorrect data scenario in the drive session table are documented and accessible.
	3.	Team members have access to the logs, the database schema, and any related resources for debugging.
	4.	The development environment is set up for reproducing and debugging the issue.
	5.	Dependencies (if any) are identified and addressed.

Definition of Done (DoD):

	1.	The get-project-details API gracefully handles incorrect data and provides a proper error response.
	2.	Code changes are peer-reviewed and merged into the main branch without conflicts.
	3.	Unit tests and integration tests are added or updated and pass successfully.
	4.	The bug is verified and closed after QA validation.
	5.	Deployment to staging and production environments is completed, and post-deployment tests confirm no regression.
	6.	Documentation is updated (e.g., API error handling guide).

You can modify this further based on your specific project or team standards.
