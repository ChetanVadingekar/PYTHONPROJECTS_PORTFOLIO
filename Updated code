Here’s your user stories rewritten in the correct format while maintaining clarity and structure:

User Story A: Handle Step Function Failure | Create and Update Resources on Dev Env

As a system administrator or developer,
I want to handle Step Function failures effectively,
so that failed transfer events are captured, notified, and logged properly.

Acceptance Criteria
	1.	Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Creation
	•	Given an EventBridge rule for DataTransfer,
	•	When a transfer event fails,
	•	Then the failed event should be captured and sent to a DLQ.
	2.	Notification SQS Creation & Integration
	•	Given a Step Function trigger Lambda (SFNTrigger Lambda),
	•	When a transfer event occurs,
	•	Then a Notification SQS queue should be created and configured as an output for the SFNTrigger Lambda.
	3.	DLQ for Notification SQS
	•	Given a Notification SQS queue,
	•	When message processing fails,
	•	Then the message should be sent to an attached DLQ for further analysis.
	4.	Error Notifier Lambda Integration
	•	Given a Notification SQS queue,
	•	When a message arrives in the queue,
	•	Then the Error Notifier Lambda should process it as a trigger event.
	5.	Error Notifier Lambda Modification
	•	Given an error message in Notification SQS,
	•	When Error Notifier Lambda processes it,
	•	Then it should parse the message and send appropriate notifications.
	6.	Test Case Updates
	•	Given the updated system components,
	•	When unit and integration tests run,
	•	Then they should cover the new functionality.
	7.	End-to-End Flow Verification
	•	Given an event in EventBridge,
	•	When it fails,
	•	Then the message should be captured in DLQ, forwarded to Notification SQS, and finally processed by Error Notifier Lambda.

User Story B: Handle Step Function Failure | Terraform Template Creation

As a DevOps engineer,
I want to create Terraform templates for failure handling,
so that AWS infrastructure for DLQ, Notification SQS, and Lambda integration is provisioned automatically.

Acceptance Criteria
	1.	Terraform Template Creation
	•	Given a need for infrastructure automation,
	•	When Terraform is applied,
	•	Then it should provision DLQ, Notification SQS, and Lambda integrations.
	2.	DLQ Configuration in Terraform
	•	Given an EventBridge rule for DataTransfer,
	•	When Terraform applies the configuration,
	•	Then a DLQ should be created and attached to EventBridge.
	3.	Notification SQS Configuration in Terraform
	•	Given a Step Function trigger Lambda,
	•	When Terraform applies the configuration,
	•	Then a Notification SQS should be created and configured as an output to DataTransfer Manifest Lambda.
	4.	Error Notifier Lambda Setup in Terraform
	•	Given a Notification SQS queue,
	•	When Terraform applies the configuration,
	•	Then the Notification SQS should be added as a trigger for Error Notifier Lambda.
	5.	Terraform Deployment Validation
	•	Given the Terraform template,
	•	When it is deployed,
	•	Then the provisioned infrastructure should match the required setup.
	6.	Terraform Testing
	•	Given the deployed Terraform template,
	•	When tested,
	•	Then it should successfully provision the expected resources.

Definition of Ready (DoR) for Both Stories
	1.	The necessary permissions to create/update AWS resources are available.
	2.	EventBridge, Lambda, and SQS services are confirmed to be available in the target environment.
	3.	Terraform template updates are clear.


This version ensures all the acceptance criteria are written in a structured and testable format while following the user story template. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
