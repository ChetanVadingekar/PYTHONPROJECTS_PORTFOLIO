I would like to request leave from 16th December to 24th December as I will be travelling for my brother's wedding, followed by a family vacation that has been planned for this period.
I would appreciate your understanding in approving this request. 
I will ensure that all my work is completed before I go on leave.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
