Subject: Leave Request from 16th December to 24th December

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I would like to request leave from 16th December to 24th December as I will be traveling for my brother’s wedding, followed by a planned family vacation.

I appreciate your understanding in considering this request, and I will ensure that all my work is completed before my leave.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
Chetan
